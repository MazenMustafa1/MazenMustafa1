## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

A Software Engineering student at the Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence,
Helwan University.  During the last 3 years, I have built a very strong foundation in programming by learning fundamental concepts such as Object-oriented Programming with C++, Data Structures and Algorithms with JavaScript, and Design Patterns with Java.
